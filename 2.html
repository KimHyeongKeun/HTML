    <h2>CSS란 무엇인가?</h2>
    
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/" target="_blank" title="HTML5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language(HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web application.
    Web browsers receive HTML documents form a web server or 
    from local storage and render them into multimedia webpages. HTML describes the structure of
    a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
    </p><p style="margin-top:40px;"> HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects,
    such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create 
    structured documents by denoting structural sematics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
    lists, links, quotes and other items, HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle
    brackets.</p>
